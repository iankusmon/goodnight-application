## ðŸ“Š RSpec Summary

Example run:
```
Finished in 1.35 seconds (files took 3.45 seconds to load)
15 examples, 0 failures
```

All model and request specs cover:

- Model validations (`Follow`, `SleepSession`)  
- Controller endpoints (SleepSessions, Follows, Feed)  
- Database constraints (unique index, check constraint)  

---

## ðŸš€ Notes for Manager

- **Reliability**: APIs handle both success and error cases gracefully.  
- **Scalability**: Indexes and DB constraints ensure data integrity even under load.  
- **Sharing Feature**: Clock Out returns share links for Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram.  
- **Team Onboarding**: Setup instructions in `README.md` allow anyone to run `bin/rspec` and confirm green tests.

âœ… **Conclusion:** The Goodnight Application backend is fully tested and ready for demo / review.
